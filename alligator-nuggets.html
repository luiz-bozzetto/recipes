    </p>
    <h3>Ingredientes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups vegetable oil</li>
        <li>5 ounces seasoned crispy fish fry seafood breading mix (Louisiana® brand)</li>
        <li>1 pound Louisiana alligator prime filet, cut into 2-inch cubes</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Passo a Passo</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Pour fish fry mix into a 1-gallon resealable plastic bag. Add alligator nuggets, reseal the bag, and shake
            to coat. Let stand for 5 minutes. Shake the bag again.</li>
        <li>Place half of seasoned alligator nuggets in the deep fryer. Cook until golden brown and nuggets float to the
            top of the oil, about 3 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted in the center should read at least 160
            degrees F (70 degrees C). Using tongs, transfer nuggets to a paper-towel lined plate.</li>
        <li>Repeat Step 3 with remaining nuggets. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
